# Hangman-game

This was a homework assignment for week2 at Codaisseur Academy.

Like a classic hangman game, player has to guess the secret word. He has 6 times to guess it, before he is hanged :)
Player can start a new game at any time by clicking on a New Game button. 

This project is done with React & Redux.
